# COVID-19-2020

# A few things I am doing in my spare time during the lockdown
## Reading about living in the present and becoming less obsessed with the future
- Currently reading "The Power of Now"
## Connecting with my friends and family on a more regular basis
- I have realized how important this is and will continue to do this after the lockdown ends
## Cooking anything and everything in my house, learning how to make bland items delicious
- researching recipies online daily has become a new hobby
## Updating my LinkedIn and overdue resume
- No reason behind this other than to keep up with my goals and achievements
## Exercising using minimal equipment
- If you know me, they gym is a must have and I take this very seriously. I started to go stir crazy until I finally realized this was a long term quarentine and I have now come to terms with this

Thanks for reading please share what you are doing!
